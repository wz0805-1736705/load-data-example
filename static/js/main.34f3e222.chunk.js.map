Introduction:</h2>\n      <div style={overallStyle}>\n        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          The dataset I am using \n          for this assignment is about the weather in the United States in 2017.\n          After download and do sanity check on the dataset, I found out that the\n          dataset includes <b>416937</b> rows and <b>15</b> columns. The column names and the \n          data types are <b>station(object), state(object), latitude(float64), \n          longitude(float64), elevation(float64), date(int64), TMIN(float64), \n          TMAX(float64), TAVG(float64), AWND(float64), WDF5(float64), WSF5(float64), \n          SNOW(float64), SNWD(float64), and PRCP(float64)</b>.\n        </p>\n        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          By looking at these columns, I came up with the question that <b>what are \n          some major factors affect the temperature, precipitation, and snow?</b>\n        </p>\n        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          In order to answer the question, I performed some data analysis process in Python\n          and also create some plots for data visualization. I also perform data cleansing\n          before I dig into the dataset. Everytime I construct dataframe for each plot, I \n          always drop rows with null values since it will cause errors when I do data \n          visualizations. In addition, when I am creating data visualizations to see the \n          relationships between longitude and other columns, I always subtract 360 from \n          the longitude if it is larger than 0 because the United States has some territory\n          in the middle of Pacific Ocean. Therefore, after subtracting 360 from those longitudes \n          it will be better to see trends and find out relationships between longitude and other \n          columns.  \n        </p>\n        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n          I chose <b>elevation, latitude, and longitude</b> as three factors to see how does each of \n          them affect the <b>maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, snow,\n          and precipitation</b>.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <h2>2.
